## 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Testing

### **1. API Response Format Mismatches**
- **Issue:** Tests expected flat response, API returned nested `{data: {...}}`
- **Fix:** Updated all test assertions to match actual API format
- **Files:** All test files

### **2. Missing Categories in Tests**
- **Issue:** Tests creating transactions without required categories
- **Fix:** Added category creation in test setUp() methods
- **Files:** MarketScopingTest, TransactionValidationTest, EditWindowTest

### **3. TransactionPolicy Not Implemented**
- **Issue:** Edit window tests failing due to missing authorization
- **Fix:** Created complete TransactionPolicy with 24h window logic
- **File:** app/Policies/TransactionPolicy.php

### **4. Validation Error Messages**
- **Issue:** Test expected exact messages, API returned slightly different format
- **Fix:** Updated test assertions to check for validation errors without exact message match
- **Files:** PaymentTest, TransactionValidationTest
